# Gommon

Common classes/utilities used in my projects. Made for redundancy, so I don't have duplicate code in my repositories.

Want to use this in your project? It's available on NuGet, and the GitHub Package Registry.

This library is compatible with any runtime that is compatible with .NET Standard 2.0.
